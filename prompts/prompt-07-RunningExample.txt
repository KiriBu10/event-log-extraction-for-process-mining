Each record in each table represents at least one event.
Never use the configuration table and never use the click table.

If a table contains one timestamp attribute and no other attribute with a textual format, then the activity_id is equal to the table name.
If a table contains multiple timestamp attributes, then each of these attributes is related to an event with the activity_id equal to the attribute name.

Use the id of the order as the case notion.
if the payment table is present in the db schema, then and only then, join the payment table with the invoice table and use the order_id from the invoice_table as the case_id for the events from the payment table.
Use the name of the table as the activity_id.

When a table does not have an attribute that contains the selected case notion, combine the necessary tables to obtain this case notion.
